## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Jupyter Notebook (a browser-based development environment for data science) is required for running the code (which is in Python 3).  

The developers of Jupyter Notebook "[**strongly recommend**](http://jupyterlab.io/install) installing Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution, which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science."

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I analyzed Spotify data from 1921-2020, and examined the following questions related to song loudness:

1. How does song loudness affect popularity?
2. How does song loudness change over the years?
3. How loud are various music genres?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A Jupyter Notebook, along with Spotify data files, are available here. The notebook illustrates my analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

I have written a post explaining my main findings yet [here](https://medium.com/@isaacyu1_96734/loudness-wars-spotify-song-analysis-d3f48bfe3ebe).
